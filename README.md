TACO TOWN - project 1

This is a simple memory / pairs type game that is designed to educate the plethora of recent transplants to CO.  The intent is to spread the one true gospel of tacos. Fake news about tacos abounds, and there is no such thing as a good taco wityh a crispy shell.
Gameplay is simple, typical memory game. 
The gameboard features a random set of twelve tacos to match, and each time you play, it's a bit different. 
Once you have cleared the board, you can learn about more tacos.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

This game is built in HTML, CSS, bootstrap, and JS/jquery.  The game function and logic is based on CSS and Jquery and HTML. The win page and subsequent modals are built in Bootsdtrap and vanilla JS. I realize this is a weird combo but it was my first attempt these two technologies and I didn't know until I was too far into it that Bootstrap's modal plugin exists. My approach was to learn to use Bootstrap , which I did get to play around with. I also was able to increase my understanding of CSS. I also wanted to include Google Maps api which I sorta did, via iframes. So not really what I wanted to do there. But I was able to build modals, which is new for me.

UNSOLVED ISSUES

Currently the Github Pages version is not really working, it's failing to load the images properly. I'm working on it with Joe.
In addition, there is a flaw in the game logic where  it sporadically shuffles the deck in such a way that one pair of cards is not a match. I will get to that bug, but I'm at a loss for now.
